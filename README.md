# yadm-prompt

yadm-prompt is a plugin for the [zeta-tomorrow](https://github.com/janebuoy/zeta-tomorrow) ZSH theme.

It displays the yadm status in the prompt, if ...

  - the current directory is not a git directory
  - is in or underneath the yadm root directory.

It reuses the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)'s git functions to display the yadm status in the prompt.
