# yadm-prompt

yadm-prompt is a plugin for the [https://github.com/janebuoy/zeta-tomorrow](zeta-tomorrow) ZSH theme. It displays the yadm
status in the prompt, if the current directory is not a git directory and
is in or underneath the yadm root directory.

It reuses the git functions from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/) to display the yadm status in the prompt.
